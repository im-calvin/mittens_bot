Hololive schedule scraping tool

# Requirement
- Python 3.x

# Notes
This program is a scraping tool. [The source page](https://schedule.hololive.tv/simple) 
says the schedule is updated every 15 minutes so this program might not deal with the latest changes. 
If you never want to miss any stream, it is recommended to follow the hololive member's Twitter account or subscribe to their Youtube channel.  

This program is available to use options. For example, you can change hololive member's name English. Please check text/help or execute with --help option.  

A video will be on schedule after it is posted. The displayed time is its published time except the premire moive.  

Some emoji will be removed from titles of the streams.  

# Timezone
You can choose other timezone if you install pytz from pip. If you want to change, edit text/timezone. Check the available timezones [Here](https://gist.github.com/heyalexej/8bf688fd67d7199be4a1682b3eec7568)
